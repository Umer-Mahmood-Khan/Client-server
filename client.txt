Variables:
sockfd: Socket file descriptor.
serv_addr, mirror_addr: Structures for server and mirror server addresses.
buff, command, gf: Buffers for storing input, commands, and temporary strings.
valid_syntax: Flag for command syntax validation.

Socket Creation: Creates a TCP socket.
Server Address Setup: Initializes the server address structure and converts IP address from text to binary.
Connection: Connects to the server using the specified address and port.

Loop Start: Enters an infinite loop to process user commands.
Buffers Initialization: Clears buffers for new input.
Input Reading: Reads input from the user.
Command Parsing: Tokenizes the input to identify the command and its parameters.
Command Handling
The code handles different commands based on the first token:

getfn: Fetches a file by name.
getfz: Fetches files within a specified size range, optionally unzipping them.
getfdb: Fetches files created before a specified date.
getfda: Fetches files created after a specified date.
fgets: Fetches files with specific extensions.
getft: Fetches files with multiple specified extensions.


Mirror Server Connection: If the server responds with "7001", it indicates the client should connect to a mirror server.
Command Exit Handling: If the command is "quitc", breaks the loop and closes the connection.
Summary
Initialization: Sets up the socket and server connection.
Command Loop: Continuously reads and processes user commands.
Command Parsing: Validates and formats commands.
Server Interaction: Sends commands and handles responses, including reconnecting to a mirror server if needed.
Termination: Gracefully closes the connection when the user quits.
