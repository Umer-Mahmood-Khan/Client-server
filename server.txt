Function Descriptions
npsd_explore_directory
This function searches for a file in a given directory and its subdirectories.

Opens a directory and reads entries.
Checks if each entry is a directory or a regular file.
If a regular file matches the target filename, it retrieves file metadata (like creation time and permissions) and stores this information in npsd_commd.
npsd_date_input_valid
This function checks if a date string is in the valid format YYYY-MM-DD.

Uses sscanf to parse the date and checks if the components are within valid ranges.
check_valid_filelist
This function checks if a given file list is not empty.

npsd_valid_exten
This function checks if a given extensions list is not empty.

processclient
This function processes client requests.

Reads commands from the client and parses them.
Handles commands like getfn, getfz, getfdb, getfda, fgets, getft, and quitc.
Executes the command and sends the response back to the client.
getfn: Finds a file by name.
getfz: Finds files within a specified size range.
getfdb: Finds files modified before a specified date.
getfda: Finds files modified after a specified date.
fgets: Finds specified files.
getft: Finds files with specified extensions.
quitc: Closes the connection.
npsd_redirecting_to_mirror
This function redirects a client to the mirror server by sending the mirror server's port number to the client.

main
This function sets up the server.

Creates a socket.
Binds it to the specified port.
Listens for incoming connections.
Accepts client connections and forks a new process to handle each client using processclient.
Main Loop
The server runs an infinite loop, accepting and processing client connections.
When a client connects, it is handled in a new process using processclient.
